                <p>What really drove me into learning to write javascript was a fascination with the ever evolving landscape of the internet. I want to etch my own marks for people to see, and hopefully inspire someone else.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p> I've been participating as a user of the internet since the age of 10 - when I logged on to the desktop we had in our kitchen. A year later I built my first desktop, and I've been tinkering with hardware and building my own PCs ever since. It took me much longer to finally start dabbling in the software side (outside of putting HTML on my MySpace profile or running the occasional command line).</p>
